  <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>
  <p>I believe that teaching is about inspiring students to become lifelong learners and confident communicators. In my classroom, I emphasize interactive, student-centered learning that encourages students to share their voices and experiences. I strive to create a safe, inclusive environment where learners are comfortable taking risks and learning from mistakes. I tailor my approach to meet diverse learning needs, recognizing that each student brings unique strengths and perspectives.</p>
  <p>Language is a powerful tool, and I aim to show students how mastering English can empower them in their academic and personal lives. My teaching philosophy includes integrating real-world content and technology to keep lessons relevant and engaging. I also value continuous reflection and professional development, as I believe a teacher should always be a curious learner. Ultimately, I hope to instill in my students a love of learning and the confidence to use English in meaningful ways.</p>
