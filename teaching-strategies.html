  <h1>Teaching Strategies</h1>
  <p>I employ a variety of strategies to engage my students and cater to their diverse needs. Below are some of the key approaches I use in my classroom:</p>

  <h2>Student-Centered Learning</h2>
  <p>My lessons are designed around students' needs and interests. I encourage student choice and voice in activities, allowing learners to connect the material to their own experiences. This approach fosters student autonomy and makes learning more relevant to them.</p>

  <h2>Differentiated Instruction</h2>
  <p>I tailor my instruction to different learning styles and proficiency levels. This includes modifying materials and assignments so each student is appropriately challenged and supported. By differentiating, advanced students stay challenged while those who need extra help receive the support they need.</p>

  <h2>Technology Integration</h2>
  <p>I incorporate educational technology to enhance learning. I use interactive language apps and multimedia presentations to make lessons more engaging and to provide students with additional ways to practice English. These tools not only boost engagement but also allow students to learn at their own pace, both in and out of the classroom.</p>

  <h2>Collaborative Learning</h2>
  <p>I often organize group work and peer-learning opportunities. Students learn by discussing and solving problems together, which helps build communication skills and creates a supportive classroom community. Working together also allows them to learn from each other's perspectives and develop interpersonal skills.</p>
